Well, I start by saying that I am still developing this app but the views I have made so far have a view that is based on a search engine of games that exist and gives some information such as release date and ratings that have been given to it.

I also integrated the authentication functions of firebase and the store also little by little I know that I will finish it and I will upload the updates that I will improve the said application little by little

I'm willing to listen to advice from people who have been in this longer than me, thank you.
